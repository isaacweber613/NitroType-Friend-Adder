## 📌 How to Use
### **Step 1: Create a Bookmark**
1. Copy this code:
   ```javascript
   javascript:void(function(){let b=Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.btn.btn--positive.btn--thinner')).filter(b=>b.innerText.includes("Add Friend")&&!b.classList.contains("is-success")),d=()=>Math.random()*(900-300)+300,i=0;function c(){i<b.length?(b[i].click(),console.log(`✅ Clicked 'Add Friend' button ${i+1} of ${b.length}`),i++,setTimeout(c,d())):alert("🎉 All friends added!")}b.length>0?c():alert("No 'Add Friend' buttons found!")})();

2. Open your browser’s bookmarks manager.
3. Click "Add New Bookmark".
4. Paste the copied code into the URL field.
5. Name it something like "NitroType Auto Add Friends". or something very short so it doesn't take up to much space in the bookmarks bar
6. Save the bookmark.

**Step 2: Use the Bookmarklet**
1. **Go to [NitroType Friends Page](https://www.nitrotype.com/friends)**.
2. Click on the **Recent** tab.
3. Click your **NitroType Auto Add Friends** bookmark.
4. Watch it **automatically add all friends** with random delays! 🎯🔥

## 🛠️ Advanced Settings
Want to tweak the script? Change the delay timing here:
```javascript
d = () => Math.random() * (1500 - 800) + 800; // Random delay between 0.8s and 1.5s
```
- **Faster clicks** → Use `(700 - 300) + 300`
- **Slower clicks** → Use `(2000 - 1000) + 1000`
